Everything in this project has been implemented correctly to the best
of my knowledge.

I discussed this assignment with Dane Roberts. I also refered to Ming's
code posted on the course website and the example code for calculating the distance
between two latitude and longitude points he posted on the course website.

I spent about 10 hours on this assignment.
