The purpose of this Git repository is to showcase the projects I completed as part of a Web Programming course I took at Tufts University. This includes an online portfolio, a simulated Marauder's Map, a network server for the Marauder's Map 

My favorite lab was responsive design because I thought it was incredible how the browser could tell what its size was and it was possible to change what was displayed on the web browser based on its size. This was one of the early labs so I was amazed at how one could write code that's responsive to something like the size of the web browser. Additionally, once the lab worked it was exciting to see the cartoon change just by adjusting the window size.

I think I have grown and learned a lot from day 1. Prior to taking this course I had no exposure to web programming so I was unaware of a lot of the principles such as client-server requests, anonymous functions, asynchronous applications, etc. While some areas are still difficult, I feel as if I have a good enough grasp of the general concepts that I could understand tutorials online to supplement and build on what I learned in this course.

The most important thing I learned in this course was how to use APIs and read their documentation. I had no idea what APIs were prior to this course and using them in the labs and assignments helped for trying to decipher the foursquare and instagram API documentation used in our semester project. This was also extremely useful because APIs are crucial for to integrate features and components from other web applications into your own.

I would like to delve deeper into client-side topics and learn more about web site design and how use jQuery because I still don't fully understand how to use jQuery to manipulate the HTML.
